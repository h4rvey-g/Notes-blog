# Mycophenolate mofetil
- Reversible inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase → blockade of purine synthesis → selective inhibition of [[../Blood/Lymphocyte|lymphocyte]] proliferation
- Indications
	- Lupus nephritis
	- Used in combination with cyclosporin or tacrolimus as transplant rejection prophylaxis
	- Rheumatic diseases (glucocorticoid sparing)
- Adverse effects
	- Infection (especially with CMV)
	- Vomiting and diarrhea
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperglycemia</span>
	- Hypertension
# Calcineurin inhibitors (calcineurin = calcium- and calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase)
- Physiologically, calcineurin activates the nuclear factor of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activated T cell</span> (NFAT) by dephosphorylating its serine-threonine residues. Activated NFAT binds to DNA and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">enables transcription of a number of cytokines (most prominently, IL-2) and other molecules (e.g., VEGF). Transcription of IL-2 ultimately leads to activation of Th2, CD8 and NK cells.</span>
