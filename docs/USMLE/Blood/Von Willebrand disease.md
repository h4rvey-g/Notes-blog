**Mixed platelet and coagulation disorders**
# Epidemiology
Most common congenital bleeding disorder.
# Pathophysiology
Deficiency or dysfunction of vWF leads to:![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240209102217.png|Pasted image 20240209102217.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysfunctional platelet adhesion → impaired primary hemostasis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced binding of factor VIII → increased degradation → ↓ factor VIII activity → impaired intrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis</span>
# Diagnostics
- ↑ Bleeding time
- Normal or ↑ aPTT (may be prolonged as a result of factor VIII deficiency)
- Ristocetin cofactor assay: measures the ability of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to agglutinate platelets.
	- Ristocetin is an antibiotic that activates vWF to bind glycoprotein Ib, thereby inducing platelet aggregation.
	- Interpretation: If ristocetin is added to blood lacking vWF (or the vWF receptor), platelets will not aggregate.
