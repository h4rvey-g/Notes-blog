The key here is to separate the effects of sodium channels and potassium channels. 
1. Sodium channel blockage = slow depolarization + wide QRS + long QT
2. Potassium channel blockage = prolonged APD + prolonged ERP. Both of these blocking effects can treat rapid cardiac arrhythmias. 
Class IA is 1+2, Class IC is only 1 (strongly). However, Class IB is different from the first two as it promotes potassium outflow, thus shortening APD and ERP and increasing ERP:APD ratio
