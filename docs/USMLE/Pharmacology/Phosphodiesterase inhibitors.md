- Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors are a heterogenic class of drugs that target various isoforms of PDE enzymes. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normally, the PDE decreases cAMP or cGMP in target cells by catalyzing the hydrolysis of these second messengers. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">By inhibiting this step, PDE inhibitors actually increase cAMP and/or cGMP concentrations. </span>
- They are classified according to their target isoforms as nonspecific, PDE5, PDE4, and PDE3 inhibitors, each of which has a different clinical use.
# Nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors (inhibitors of PDE3, 4, and 5)
- Theophylline
- Indications
	- COPD (severe and refractory cases)
	- Asthma
## Adverse effects
- General considerations
	- Close drug monitoring due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">narrow therapeutic index (high risk of overdose).</span>
	- Metabolized in the liver by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cytochrome P450 oxidase system.</span>
		- â†‘ Risk of drug interactions (e.g., ciprofloxacin can increase theophylline serum levels).
- Cardiotoxicity
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tachycardia, arrhythmias</span>
- Neurotoxicity (dosage-dependent)
	- At low levels of overdose: dizziness, lightheadedness, headache
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">At high levels of overdose: seizures</span>
- Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity
	- Severe refractory nausea and vomiting
	- Diarrhea
	- Abdominal pain
