# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Babesia species (e.g., Babesia microti)
- Vector: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deer tick (Ixodes scapularis)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ticks are often coinfected; therefore, patients with babesiosis often also have Lyme disease.</span>
- Distribution
	- In the US, B. microti causes endemic disease in midwestern (especially Minnesota and Wisconsin) and northeastern states.

# Clinical features
---
- Fever and other flu-like symptoms
- Anorexia
- Nonproductive cough
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Renal/Urine color|Dark urine]], jaundice from hemolytic [[../Blood/Anemia|anemia]]</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mild [[../Blood/Splenomegaly|splenomegaly]] and/or [[../GI/Hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly]]</span>
- Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically no rash</span>; may have petechiae, ecchymoses

# Diagnostics
---
- CBC: ↓ hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, ↑ reticulocyte count
- Modalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripheral blood smear showing Babesia as intraerythrocytic rings and/or Maltese cross </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240305155054.png|Pasted image 20240305155054.png]]
	- Detection of Babesia DNA on a blood sample (e.g., PCR)
