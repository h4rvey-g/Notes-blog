# Atypical antidepressants
## Mirtazapine
- Mechanism of action 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Selective α2-adrenergic antagonist → ↑ [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|serotonin]] and norepinephrine release</span>
	- 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists → ↑ effect of serotonin on free 5-HT1 receptor is the likely cause of antidepressant action
	- H1 antagonist
- Indications: [[./Major depressive disorder|major depressive disorder]], especially in patients who are underweight and/or who have insomnia
- Side effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Appetite and weight gain</span>: can also be a desired effect
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sedation (due to H1 antagonism)</span>: can also be a desired effect
	- ↑ Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels
	- Minimal sexual side effects
- Drug interactions: risk of [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|serotonin]] syndrome if used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs

## Bupropion
- Mechanism of action: increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels via reuptake inhibition 
- Indications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking cessation: used in conjunction with counseling and nicotine replacement</span> (see “Nicotine use disorder”)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]]</span>
- Side effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulant effect</span>
	- Tachycardia, palpitations
	- Weight loss
	- Neuropsychiatric symptoms: insomnia, agitation, headache
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduction of seizure threshold: Bupropion should be avoided in patients at increased risk for seizure (e.g., history of epilepsy, anorexia/bulimia, alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal).</span>
	- Does not cause sexual side effects
	- Dry mouth
- Drug interactions: risk of [[../Neurology/Serotonin syndrome|serotonin syndrome]] if used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs
>[!tip] 
>Buproprion is not associated with sexual dysfunction or weight gain. It is contraindicated in patients with seizure and eating disorders.
# Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
- Drugs
	- <font color="#ffc000">Tranylcypromine</font>
	- Phenelzine
	- Selegiline
- Indications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[./Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]] (third- or fourth-line therapy): particularly effective treatment for atypical depression</span>
	- [[../Neurology/Parkinson disease|Parkinson disease]]: selegiline (as an adjunct to carbidopa-levodopa)
- Side effects
	- CNS stimulation
	- Sexual dysfunction
	- Orthostatic hypotension
	- Weight gain
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[../Cardiology/Hypertensive crises|Hypertensive crisis]] with ingestion of foods containing tyramine</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Examples: aged cheeses, smoked/cured meats, alcoholic beverages (especially beer and red wine), dried fruits, fava beans, chocolate</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tyramine stimulates the sympathetic nervous system by releasing other [[../Neurology/Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters]], such as noradrenaline, from vesicles into the synaptic cleft.</span>
# Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA)
- Mechanism of action: inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in synaptic cleft → ↑ serotonin and norepinephrine levels 
- Drugs
	- Secondary amines 
		- Nortriptyline
		- Desipramine
		- Protriptyline
		- Amoxapine
	- Tertiary amines 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amitriptyline</span>
		- Clomipramine
		- Doxepin
		- Imipramine
		- Trimipramine
- Indications
	- [[./Major depressive disorder|Major depressive disorder]] (third- or fourth-line therapy)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuropathic pain (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, [[../Endocrine/Diabetic neuropathy|diabetic neuropathy]], postherpetic neuralgia)</span>
	- Chronic pain (including [[../MSK/Fibromyalgia|fibromyalgia]])
	- Migraine prophylaxis
	- Clomipramine specifically: OCD
	- Imipramine specifically: nocturnal enuresis (limited use due to side effects)
- Side effects
	- Orthostatic hypotension 
	- Cardiotoxicity due to Na+ channel inhibition in the myocardium: changes in cardiac conductivity velocity, arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval (predisposes to [[../Cardiology/Torsades de pointes|torsades de pointes]]), wide QRS complex
	- Tremor
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticholinergic symptoms due to blockage of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (more common with tertiary amines)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TCAs have structural similarities to acetylcholine, enabling them to bind to and block muscarinic receptors.</span>
		- Cardiovascular: tachycardia, arrhythmia (including ventricular fibrillation), hypotension
		- CNS: confusion, hallucinations, sedation, seizures (confusion and hallucinations are most commonly seen in older patients)
		- Gastrointestinal: constipation
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Genitourinary: urinary retention</span>
		- General: xerostomia
