# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
## Prerenal
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased blood supply to kidneys (due to hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal vasoconstriction)</span> → failure of renal vascular autoreg<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"></span>ulation to maintain renal perfusion <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">→ decreased GFR → activation of renin-angiotensin system → increased aldosterone release → increased reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup>, H2O → increased [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]] → secretion of antidiuretic hormone → increased reabsorption of H2O and urea</span>
- Creatinine is still secreted in the proximal tubules, so the blood [[./BUN-creatinine ratio|BUN:creatinine ratio]] increases.
## Intrinsic
- Damage to a vascular or tubular component of the nephron → necrosis or apoptosis of tubular cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased reabsorption capacity of electrolytes</span> (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>), water, and/or urea (depending on the location of injury along the tubular system) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased Na<sup>+</sup> and H2O in the urine</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased [[./Urine osmolality|Urine osmolality]]</span>
