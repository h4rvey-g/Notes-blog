- Neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells
	- Bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells → suppression of hematopoiesis → leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cell proliferation → pro-osteoclastogenic factors (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, RANK-L) → osteolytic lesions → [[../Cardiology/Hypercalcemia|hypercalcemia]]</span>
- Overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin and/or light chains → dysproteinemia (a state of pathologically increased synthesis of immunoglobulins and/or their subunits) → kidney damage (e.g., myeloma cast nephropathy) and/or paraprotein tissue deposition (may cause [[../Pathology/Amyloidosis|amyloidosis]]) 
	- Nonfunctioning antibodies → functional antibody deficiency
	- ↑ Serum viscosity → hyperviscosity syndrome
