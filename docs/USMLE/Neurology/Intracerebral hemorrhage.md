# Pathophysiology
- Nontraumatic mechanisms of hemorrhage
	- Chronic arterial hypertension → lipohyalinosis of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lenticulostriate vessels (which supply the basal ganglia)</span> and/or formation and rupture of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms</span> → lacunar strokes (ischemia) of the basal ganglia
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Putamen most commonly affected, which is supplied by lenticulostriate arteries</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240309151748.png|Pasted image 20240309151748.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231224102741.png|Pasted image 20231224102741.png]]
		- Other locations: thalamus (second most common) and infratentorial parts of the brain (e.g., pons, cerebellum)
	- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: deposition of β-amyloid peptides in vessel walls → focal damage with formation of microaneurysms → rupture → recurrent lobar intracerebral hemorrhage
- Traumatic: blunt or penetrating injury → damage to vessels

# Clinical features
- Headache
- Focal neurologic signs and symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Putaminal hemorrhage: contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia with less severe contralateral hemisensory loss; eyes deviate toward the side of the hematoma </span>
		- Thalamic hemorrhage: contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral hemisensory loss, decreased consciousness, wrong way eyes

>[!Mnemonic] 
>- The dorsal striatum is composed of both the caudate and the putamen.
>- The caudate is involved in both motor activity as well as more cognitive functions, while the putamen is primarily involved in motor activity.
>- The <font color="#ffc000">cau</font>date nucleus is the most <font color="#ffc000">cau</font>gnitive part of the basal ganglia.
>- When you see <font color="#ffc000">put-am-en</font> on an exam, <font color="#ffc000">“put-an-em” for Motor</font>.
- Course
	- Symptoms typically progress gradually over minutes to a few hours
	- Focal deficits worsen with expansion of the hematoma
	- Late: symptoms of increased ICP
		- Nausea and vomiting
		- Confusion and loss of consciousness
		- Bradycardia
		- Fixed pupils
