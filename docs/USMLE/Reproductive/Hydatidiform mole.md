# Epidemiology

# Etiology
## Complete mole
- Fertilization of an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">empty egg that does not carry any chromosomes</span> by a single sperm
- Fetal karyotypes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">46XX (more common; ∼ 90% of cases)</span>
	- 46XY (less common; ∼ 10% of cases)
## Partial mole
- Fertilization of an egg containing a haploid set of chromosomes with two sperms
- Fetal karyotypes
	- 69XXY
	- 69XXX

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vaginal bleeding during the first trimester</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uterus size greater</span> than normal for gestational age
- Pelvic pressure or pain
- Passage of vesicles with grape-like appearance
- β-hCG-mediated endocrine conditions
	- Theca lutein cysts
	- Preeclampsia (before the 20th week of gestation)
	- Hyperemesis gravidarum
	- [[../Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism|Hyperthyroidism]]: Very high amounts of hCG may lead to [[../Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]] because the α-subunit of hCG structurally resembles TSH.
