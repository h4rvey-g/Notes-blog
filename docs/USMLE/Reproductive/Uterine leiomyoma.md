# Etiology
## Predisposing factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nulliparity</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early menarche (&lt; 10 years of age)</span>
- Age: 25â€“45 years
	- Fibroids are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">largely found in women of reproductive age.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Influenced by hormones</span> (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, and progesterone)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During [[./Menopause|menopause]], hormone levels begin to decrease and leiomyomas begin to shrink.</span>
- Increased incidence in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">African American individuals </span>

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
Symptoms depend on the number, size, and location of leiomyomas. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most women have small, asymptomatic fibroids.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal menstruation</span> (possibly associated with anemia): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypermenorrhea</span>, heavy menstrual bleeding, metrorrhagia, dysmenorrhea
	- Submucosal leiomyomas are most frequently associated with significantly prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding. The mechanism may be related to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased total surface area as a result of the bulging uterine wall, impaired uterine wall contractility, or micro/macrovascular abnormalities.</span>
- Features of mass effect
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enlarged, firm and irregular uteru</span>s during bimanual pelvic examination 
		- Size can range from normal to full-term gestation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Back or pelvic pain/discomfort </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urinary tract or bowel symptoms</span> (e.g., urinary frequency/retention/incontinence, constipation, features of hydronephrosis) 
- Reproductive abnormalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Infertility (difficulty conceiving and increased risk of pregnancy loss) </span>
		- Related to an obstructed uterine cavity and/or impaired contractility of the uterus.
	- Dyspareunia

# Diagnostics
>[!warning] 
>Uterine leiomyomas are extremely common (affecting 70% of women) and are often found incidentally on ultrasound; do not attribute abnormal uterine bleeding to leiomyomas until other etiologies have been ruled out!
