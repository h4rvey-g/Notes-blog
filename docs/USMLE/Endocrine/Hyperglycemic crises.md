### Intracellular potassium deficit
- As a result of hyperglycemic hyperosmolality, potassium shifts along with water from inside cells to the extracellular space and is lost in the urine.
- Insulin normally promotes cellular potassium uptake but is absent in DKA, compounding the problem.
- A total body potassium deficit develops in the body, although serum potassium may be normal or even paradoxically elevated.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insulin deficiency → hyperosmolality → K+ shift out of cells + lack of insulin to promote K+ uptake → intracellular K+ depleted → total body K+ deficit despite normal or even elevated serum K+</span>
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">There is a total body potassium deficit in DKA.</span> This becomes important during treatment, when insulin replacement leads to rapid potassium uptake by depleted cells and patients may require potassium replacement.
## HHS
- Primarily affects patients with type 2 diabetes
- The pathophysiology of HHS is similar to that of DKA.
- However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in HHS, there are still small amounts of insulin being secreted by the pancreas, and this is sufficient to prevent DKA by suppressing lipolysis and, in turn, ketogenesis. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HHS is characterized by symptoms of marked dehydration (and loss of electrolytes) due to the predominating hyperglycemia and osmotic diuresis.</span>
