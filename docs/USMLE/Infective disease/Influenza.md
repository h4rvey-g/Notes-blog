## Secondary bacterial bronchitis and [[../Respiratory/Pneumonia|pneumonia]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Etiology: Common causative pathogens include S. pneumoniae, S. aureus (including MRSA), S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae.</span>
- Pathophysiology
	- Influenza virus attacks the tracheobronchial epithelium and results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased cell size and a loss of cilia, which promotes bacterial colonization.</span>
	- The influenza surface protein neuraminidase also cleaves sialic acid off host glycoproteins, leading to an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased amount of free sugar in the respiratory tract, which fosters bacterial growth.</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Development of a purulent, productive cough ∼ 4–14 days after an initial period of improvement </span>
	- Recurrent fever
	- Symptoms similar to community-acquired [[../Respiratory/Pneumonia|pneumonia]]
