- Hormone receptors (HR) positive
	- [[./Androgen and estrogen synthesis|Estrogen]] receptor
	- Progestogen receptor
- Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu, c-erbB2) positive
- Triple negative
### Prognosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hormone-negative breast cancer has a poorer prognosis than hormone-positive breast cancer. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HER2-positive tumors show aggressive growth and metastasize quickly compared to HER2-negative tumors. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Triple-negative disease is associated with a poor prognosis.</span>
