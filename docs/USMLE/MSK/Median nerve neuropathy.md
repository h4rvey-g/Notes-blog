- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The key is whether flexor digitorum profundus is damaged.</span>
- Nerves controlling flexor digitorum profundus branches out below the elbow. So it's spared in distal lesion, but included in proximal lesion. So the claw hand is more prominent in distal lesion.
- Anterior Interosseous Nerve -> flexor digitorum profundus -> flexion of index and middle finger![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240221084813.png|Pasted image 20240221084813.png]]
	- Flexor digitorum profundus
		- has dual innervation: the medial part is supplied by ulnar nerve
		- Controls wrist, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MCP, and DIP joints</span>: flexion
- Flexor digitorum superficialis
	- Controls wrist, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MCP, and PIP joints</span>: flexion
- Lumbricals and interossei![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240221090820.png|Pasted image 20240221090820.png]]
- Ape hand: inability to oppose and abduct the thumb due to injury of the proximal or distal median nerves impairing the thenar muscles' functions
