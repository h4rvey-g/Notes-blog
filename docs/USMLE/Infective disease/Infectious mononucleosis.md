# Epidemiology
---
- General: Approx. 90–95% of adults are EBV-seropositive worldwide.
- Peak incidence (of symptomatic disease): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">15–24 years of age</span>

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also called human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4)
- Transmission: Infectious mononucleosis spreads via bodily secretions, especially saliva. Therefore, it is also called kissing disease.

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">EBV infects B lymphocytes in mucosal epithelium (e.g., oropharynx, cervix) via the CD21 receptor</span> → infected B lymphocytes induce a humoral (B-cell) as well as a cellular (T-cell) immune response  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">an increased concentration of atypical lymphocytes in the bloodstream, which are CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that fight infected B lymphocytes</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The name "mononucleosis" is derived from the monocyte-like appearance of (atypical) lymphocytes under the microscope.</span>
	- The T-cell response is crucial for overcoming the infection. However, if the response is not sufficient (e.g., in HIV patients), B cells may proliferate uncontrollably and increase the risk of complications. For example, the high rate of proliferation increases the risk of oncogenic mutations that lead to the development of B-cell lymphomas.

# Clinical features
---
- Incubation period: ∼ 6 weeks
- Clinical course
	- Symptoms typically occur in adolescents and young adults and last for 2–4 weeks.
- Signs and symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Splenomegaly</span>, fever, fatigue, malaise 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis</span> (reddened, enlarged tonsils covered in pus), palatal petechiae 
	- Bilateral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cervical lymphadenopathy</span> (especially posterior) that may become generalized and can, in severe cases, lead to airway obstruction
	- Abdominal pain
	- Possibly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hepatomegaly</span> and jaundice 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Maculopapular rash (similar to measles): The rash is caused by the infection itself in about 5% of cases but is most commonly associated with the empiric administration of aminopenicillin (e.g., ampicillin, amoxicillin)</span>

>[!warning] 
>Splenomegaly can lead to a potentially life-threatening splenic rupture!
# Diagnostics
---
- Monospot test
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Detects heterophile antibodies produced in response to EBV infection using RBCs from sheep or horses</span>
	- Patient's serum is mixed with a solution of sheep/horse RBC in vitro
		- Positive test: cross-reaction between heterophile antibodies and sheep/horse RBCs → agglutination
		- Negative test
			- No heterophile antibodies present → no cross-reaction → no agglutination
			- In some cases, the test can show negative results if it is performed too soon (i.e. within the first 1–2 weeks after symptom onset) and antibodies have not developed yet.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Specificity of ∼ 100%, sensitivity of 85%</span>
