# [[./Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]] food poisoning
- Pathogen: [[./Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]]
	- Gram-positive bacterium
	- Some strains produce <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">heat-stable staphylococcal enterotoxins</span> that cause food poisoning and, in severe cases, toxic shock syndrome. 
- Transmission
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ingestion of preformed toxins</span> in contaminated food
	- Bacteria proliferate in inadequately refrigerated food (meat, mayonnaise, potato salad, custards).
	- While [[./Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]] is destroyed by cooking, the heat-stable enterotoxins are not.
