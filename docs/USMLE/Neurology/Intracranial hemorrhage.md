# Subarachnoid hemorrhage
## Diagnosis
### CT head without contrast
- Defining feature: blood in subarachnoid space (hyperdense) with variable extension and location![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231011165433.png|Pasted image 20231011165433.png]]![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231011165456.png|Pasted image 20231011165456.png]]
## Complications
### Vasospasm
- Occurs in approx. 30% of patients with SAH
- Pathophysiology
	- Impaired CSF reabsorption from the arachnoid villi → nonobstructive (communicating) hydrocephalus → ↑ intracranial pressure → ↓ cerebral perfusion pressure → ischemia
	- Release of clotting factors and vasoactive substances → diffuse vasospasm of cerebral vessels  → ischemia

- Most common in patients with nontraumatic SAH due to a ruptured aneurysm
- Usually occurs between <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">3–10 days after SAH</span>
- Oral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nimodipine</span> should be given after subarachnoid hemorrhage to prevent vasospasm
