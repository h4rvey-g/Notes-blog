## Cutaneous lesions
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Well-demarcated, erythematous plaques and/or papules with silver-white scaling</span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240227155147.png|Pasted image 20240227155147.png]]
- Located mainly on the scalp, trunk, elbows, and knees (extensor surfaces)![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240227155212.png|Pasted image 20240227155212.png]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pruritus in âˆ¼ 80% of cases</span>
- Characteristic features may be present.
	- Auspitz sign 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Small pinpoint bleeding when scales are scraped off</span>
		- Removal of the scales exposes the dermal papillae, which leads to bleeding.
	- Koebner phenomenon: Physical stimuli or skin injury (e.g., trauma, scratching, irritating clothing) can lead to the appearance of psoriatic skin lesions on previously unaffected skin (isomorphic response).
## Nail involvement
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nail pitting: small, round depressions in the nail</span> 
- Brittle nails: nail dystrophy with crumbling of the nail
- Onycholysis: partial and mostly distal separation of the nail plate
