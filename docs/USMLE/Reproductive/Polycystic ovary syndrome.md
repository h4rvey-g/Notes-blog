<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligoovulation/anovulation, and/or the presence of polycystic ovaries</span>
# Epidemiology
- Prevalence: 6–12% of women in their reproductive years in the US

# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
>[!tip] Key points
><font color="#ffc000">↑LH → ↑↑↑androgen, beyond the conversion capacity to estrogen → ↑↑↑androgen inhibits FSH, causing more LH → no LH surge, oligoovulation/anovulation</font>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strong association with obesity → ↑ in peripheral estrogen synthesis from adipose tissue and ↓ in peripheral sensitivity to insulin</span>
	- Estrogen is also produced in other aromatase-containing tissues: Fatty tissue, Placenta
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced insulin sensitivity (peripheral insulin resistance) and the consequent hyperinsulinemia</span> result in: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑LH</span>:FSH
	- Epidermal hyperplasia and hyperpigmentation ([[../MSK/Acanthosis nigricans|acanthosis nigricans]])
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Androgen production in ovarian theca interna cells</span> → imbalance between androgen precursors and the resulting estrogen produced in granulosa cells
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ LH secretion disrupts the LH/FSH balance → impaired follicle maturation → unruptured follicles and anovulation/oligoovulation</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">→ cyst formation</span> and infertility![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231208172457.png|Pasted image 20231208172457.png]]
		- ↑ Androgen precursor release and ↑ estrogen production in adipose tissue
	- Inhibition of SHBG in the liver → ↑ free androgens and estrogens
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Unopposed estrogen (lack of progesterone) during anovulatory cycles → endometrial hyperplasia → ↑ risk of endometrial carcinoma</span>
