# Pathophysiology
- Gout
	- An inflammatory crystal arthropathy that is caused by the precipitation and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deposition of uric acid crystals in synovial fluid and tissues.</span>
	- It is typically associated with hyperuricemia, but can also occur if uric acid levels are normal.
- Uric acid
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An end-product of purine metabolism that is excreted by the kidneys</span>
	- Has somewhat <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">poor water solubility</span>
	- Predisposes to gout
- Triggers of urate crystal deposition
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Uric acid levels (due to insufficient excretion or increased production of purines)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acidosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low temperature (e.g., cool peripheral joints)</span>
- Crystalline arthritis: supersaturation of uric acid in extracellular fluid → intraarticular uric crystal precipitation (coated by IgGs) → phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells → release of inflammatory mediators and enzymes → local joint inflammation
- Chronic effects: repeated attacks → aggregations of urate crystals and giant cells (tophi) → deformities and arthritis

### Colchicine  
- Mechanism of action: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">binds and stabilizes tubulin subunits → inhibits microtubule polymerization → inhibits phagocytosis of urate crystals, neutrophil activation, migration, and degranulation </span>
- Adverse effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., diarrhea</span>, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, are the most common.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rhabdomyolysis</span> , myopathy
	- [[../Neurology/Polyneuropathy|Polyneuropathy]]  
	- Cardiac toxicity, arrhythmias
	- Nephrotoxicity
	- Myelosuppression
	- CNS symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache)

>[!tip] 
>Colchicine is unlikely to be effective when initiated > 24–36 hours after symptom onset. Colchicine is preferable in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., patients with gastrointestinal ulcers)
