# Clinical features
- Auscultation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Harsh crescendo-decrescendo (diamond-shaped), late systolic ejection murmur that radiates bilaterally to the carotids</span>
		- Best heard in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">2nd right intercostal space </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Handgrip decreases the intensity of the murmur. </span>
		- Valsalva and standing from squatting <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreases</span> or does not change the intensity of the murmur (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in contrast to [[./Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy|hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]</span>). 
	- Soft S2 
		- A soft S2 results from a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">delay in the aortic component (A2) and softer closing of the aortic valve due to reduced mobility.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">S4 is best heard at the apex. </span>
		- Because of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased compliance of the LV</span>
	- Early systolic ejection click 
		- Results from the abrupt stop of the valve leaflets upon opening
