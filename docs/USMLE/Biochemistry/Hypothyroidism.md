# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary hypothyroidism: insufficient thyroid hormone production</span>
	- [[../Endocrine/Hashimoto thyroiditis|Hashimoto thyroiditis]]
		- The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions
		- Associated with HLA-DR3 and other autoimmune diseases (e.g., vitiligo, pernicious anemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and [[../Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus erythematosus]])
	- Postpartum thyroiditis (subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis) 
	- [[../Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis|De Quervain thyroiditis]] (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis): often subsequent to a flu-like illness
	- Iatrogenic: e.g., post thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, antithyroid medication (e.g., amiodarone, lithium)
	- Nutritional (insufficient intake of iodine): the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, particularly in iodine-deficient regions
	- Riedel thyroiditis: occurs in IgG4-related systemic disease
	- Wolff-Chaikoff effect
	- Thyroid dysplasia: a disorder of embryologic development characterized by abnormal development and/or location of thyroid tissue (e.g., lingual thyroid)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary hypothyroidism: pituitary disorders (e.g., pituitary adenoma) → TSH deficiency</span>
- Tertiary hypothyroidism: hypothalamic disorders → TRH deficiency
