- Classification: based on radiological findings 
- Osteoblastic metastasis
	- New bone formation by osteoblasts outweighs osteolytic processes → increase in radiographic density
	- Examples: [[../Renal/Prostate cancer|prostate cancer]], small cell [[../Respiratory/Lung cancer|lung cancer]]
- Osteolytic metastasis
	- Osteolytic processes outweigh new bone formation → decrease in radiographic density
	- Examples: multiple myeloma, [[../Endocrine/Thyroid cancer|thyroid cancer]], kidney cancer, [[./Melanoma|melanoma]], non-small cell [[../Respiratory/Lung cancer|lung cancer]]
- Mixed metastasis: e.g., breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer
