HFE gene defect (homozygous) → defective binding of transferrin to its receptor → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ hepcidin synthesis by the liver → unregulated ferroportin activity in enterocytes → ↑ intestinal iron [[../GI/Absorption|absorption]]</span> → iron accumulation throughout the body → damage to the affected organs![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20231029090123.png|Pasted image 20231029090123.png]]
