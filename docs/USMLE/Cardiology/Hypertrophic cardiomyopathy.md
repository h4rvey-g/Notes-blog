- Mechanisms of obstruction
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, results in mitral-septal contact during mid-to-late systole</span> ; caused by either or both:![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120195607.png|Pasted image 20240120195607.png]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venturi effect: accelerated blood flow through ventricular outflow tract creates negative pressure that pulls the mitral valve towards the septum → increased outflow tract obstruction</span>
		- Ejection against an elongated and distorted mitral valve causes leaflets to get pulled into the outflow tract → potential secondary mitral regurgitation 
	- Muscular obstruction
		- Encroachment of the LVOT by the hypertrophic septum
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LVOT obstruction is dynamic </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The following factors can increase the degree of obstruction: ↑ LV contractility, ↓ preload, and ↓ afterload </span>
	- Clinically exacerbating factors 
		- These factors lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased heart contraction force</span> and cardiac output and, thus, enhance the ejection flow. This <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increases the Venturi effect</span> force described above.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physical exercise/stress</span>
		- Dehydration
		- Pharmacologic provocation (e.g., diuretics, ACEIs/ARBs, [[./Cardiac glycosides|digoxin]], hydralazine)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Valsalva maneuver (strain phase)</span>
			- Leads to decreased preload
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compare with [[./Aortic valve stenosis|Aortic stenosis]], which alleviates upon Valsalva maneuver</span>

# Clinical features
- Symptoms: worsen with exercise, dehydration, and use of certain drugs (e.g., diuretics, hydralazine, ACEIs/ARBs, [[./Cardiac glycosides|digoxin]]) [6]
	- Frequently asymptomatic (especially the nonobstructive type)
	- Exertional dyspnea
	- [[./Coronary artery disease|Angina]] pectoris 
	- Dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope
	- Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden cardiac death (particularly during or after intense physical activity)</span>
- Physical examination 
	- Systolic ejection murmur (crescendo-decrescendo)  
		- Increases with Valsalva maneuver, standing, inotropic drugs (e.g., [[./Cardiac glycosides|digitalis]]) 
		- Decreases with:
			- Hand grip, squatting, or passive leg elevation
			- Drugs that decrease cardiac contractility (e.g., beta blockers)
	- Possible holosystolic murmur from mitral regurgitation
	- Sustained apex beat
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">S4 gallop</span>
	- Paradoxical split of S2 
	- Pulsus bisferiens: LV outflow obstruction causes a sudden quick rise of the pulse followed by a slower longer rise (biphasic pulse).

>HOCM is an important cause of sudden cardiac death in young patients!
