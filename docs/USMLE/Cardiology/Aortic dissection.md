# Complications
- Aortic rupture and acute blood loss: acute back and flank pain (tearing pain), symptoms of shock → indication for emergency surgery
- Complications of Stanford type A dissections
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myocardial infarction (coronary artery occlusion)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aortic regurgitation (extension of the dissection into the aortic valve)</span>
	- Cardiac tamponade progressing to cardiogenic shock
	- Stroke (extension of the dissection into the carotids)
- Complications of both Stanford type A dissection and Stanford type B dissections
	- Arterial occlusion followed by ischemia of the:
		- Celiac trunk, superior/inferior mesenteric artery → acute abdomen, ischemic colitis
		- Renal arteries → [[../Renal/Acute kidney injury|acute renal failure]] (oliguria, anuria)
		- Spinal arteries → weakness of lower extremities or acute paraplegia
