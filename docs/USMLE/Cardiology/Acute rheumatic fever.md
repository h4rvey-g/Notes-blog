# Etiology
- Previous infection with group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS), also referred to as [[../Infective disease/Streptococcus pyogenes|Streptococcus pyogenes]]
	- Usually acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis (“strep throat”)
	- GAS infections of the skin (e.g., erysipelas, impetigo, cellulitis) tend to be complicated by [[../Renal/Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis|poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]] rather than rheumatic fever.

# Pathophysiology
- Most commonly accepted mechanism involves the following: acute tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by GAS without antibiotic treatment → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">development of antibodies against streptococcal M protein → cross-reaction of antibodies with nerve and myocardial proteins (most commonly myosins)</span> due to molecular mimicry → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">type II hypersensitivity reaction</span> → acute inflammatory sequela

## ECG
- Most common: prolonged PR interval (first-degree AV block)  
- Potential additional findings include:
	- Second-degree AV block 
	- Complete heart block 
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Accelerated junctional rhythm
	- ECG features of pericarditis

>[!tip] 
>Whenever you see marked <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">left atrial abnormality or [[./Atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]] in the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy signs</span>, always think about rheumatic mitral valve disease. Mitral stenosis is the only single lesion that can readily account for the combination of left atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.
## Pathology
- Myocardial findings
	- Aschoff bodies 
		- Granuloma of rheumatic inflammation
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Central area of fibrinoid necrosis</span>
		- Surrounded by characteristic multinucleated giant cells (Aschoff cells) and other inflammatory cells (mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and T lymphocytes) due to a [[../Immunology/Type IV hypersensitivity reaction|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]]. ![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120172139.png|Pasted image 20240120172139.png]]
	- Anitschkow cells
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cardiac histiocytes (mononuclear cells) appearing in Aschoff bodies</span>
		- Large and elongated cells
		- Longitudinal section: ovoid nucleus containing wavy, caterpillar-like bar of chromatin (caterpillar cell)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Transverse section: owl-eye appearance </span>![[../../assets/img/Pasted image 20240120172347.png|Pasted image 20240120172347.png]]
